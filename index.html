                    You are the best character in the 2D beat-em-up adventure
                    game of your life. You have the most powerful roundhouse
                    kick, the best hidden moves and the most sought-after cheat
                    codes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But somewhere along the way, you lost your fire. You saw
                    people claim ground you thought was yours by right, saw
                    lesser mortals scale mountains and draw water from wells
                    you thought were dry.
                </p>

                <p>Round 1 was a tie. It&rsquo;s time for round 2.</p>

                <h2>Round 2 is about two crucial things:</h2>

                <ul class="rounds">
                    <li class="round round1">
                        <h3>Repay your <span class="keyword">fortune</span></h3>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes you&rsquo;ll trip over a pot of gold.
                            When that happens, recognise your fortune and pay it
                            back by doing work that justifies the good luck
                            you&rsquo;ve received.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Got a dream contract? Work that little bit harder
                            to keep it. Found a bit of spare cash? Use it on
                            something that&rsquo;ll improve your life and/or
                            work, or the lives of those around you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Recognise in others when they&rsquo;ve been lucky
                            and have paid it back. Respect them, and turn any
                            petty envy you have into fuel.
                        </p>

                            No matter how much you want something, no-one is
                            just going to give it to you. You might get a lucky
                            start, but now that you&rsquo;re repaying that luck
                            with effort, it&rsquo;s time to work to your next
                            big goal.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Do this with determination and singular focus. Make
                            the most of your productive hours, and be aware of
                            those micro-breaks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Start your day right, with a clear head and a bit of
                            exercise, and you&rsquo;ll be ready to take the
                            rough with the smooth.
